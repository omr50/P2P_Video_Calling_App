Implement:
- Websocket connection between media server & signaling server
    - non blocking socket connection on both client/server 
    - how to set different message types 
    - depending on type of message (not the websock library types) use different struct to unmarshal json
        - this is good for decoding a message without a known message type (using json.RawMessage)
        - Message types 
            - friend request(? not sure if i should do this yet, or just call anyone)
            - call request  
            - end call 
            - stun exchange 
            - key exchange
- Stun queries and send it through the web socket server 
- Create keys on both client/server 
- Search for friends/people to call
    - see who is online (if they are in your friend group)
- Signup/Login
    - implement bare minimum signup, login, jwt, sql database storage 
    - implement further validation for correct email, email verification to activate account (& more sql fields)
    - Some sort of persistent storage of JWT so the user doesn't have to re-log in?
    - secret keys for jwt and other secrets should be moved to an env file or other secret, non shared location

- Redis
    - implement redis for holding the websocket connections that are activate
    - easy way for the server to fetch clients when requests come in
    - also when calls close they can inform the other party in call that its over if the other crashes
      and doesn't send the end call message
